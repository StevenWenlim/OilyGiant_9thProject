# OilyGiant_9thProject
This project is my project in sprint 9, which is Machine Learning in Business.

In this srpint i learn how to find business metrics, conducting A/B testing, using bootstrapping techniques, and labeling data..

# Project Overview

In this project, I worked for an oil mining company named OilyGiant. My task was to find suitable locations for drilling new oil wells. I created a model that would help select areas with the highest profit margin. I analyzed the potential profit and risks using bootstrapping techniques.

Based on the observation, here are some findings that I obtained:
1.	A well must have an oil volume greater than 112 (thousand barrels) for its investment to be profitable.
2.	On average, the three regions have 20 million out of 100 million points that qualify for development.
3.	If we develop the top 200 wells in each region, the highest profit will be obtained in the region 1 with a total profit of almost 40 million USD.
4.	If we invest money in the top 200 wells in these three regions, we will still generate profits from all three regions.
5.	The region with the highest profit is produced in region 0.
6.	Region 0 also has the highest number of points above 112.

After analyzing and creating the model, the following is a summary of the project:

This project resulted in a model that is capable of predicting the volume of oil reserves in a well, with the hope that the investment made will generate profit. Based on the model's predictions, it was found that region 2 has the highest average oil reserves. To generate profit, an oil well must have at least 112 thousand barrels of oil reserves.

After performing the bootstrapping process, it was found that investing in region 2 carries high risk with the lowest average income compared to the other two regions. Therefore, I recommend investing in region 1, which has the lowest risk and the highest profit.
