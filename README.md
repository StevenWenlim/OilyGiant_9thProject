# OilyGiant_9thProject
In this project, I worked for an oil mining company named OilyGiant. My task was to find suitable locations for drilling new oil wells. I created a model that would help select areas with the highest profit margin. I analyzed the potential profit and risks using bootstrapping techniques.
